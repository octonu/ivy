     <strong>Harvard University</strong> is a private Ivy League research university <u>in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</u>
      <u>Established in 1636 and named for clergyman John Harvard</u> (its first benefactor), its history, influence, and wealth have made it one of the world's most prestigious universities.[8]
      Harvard is the United States' oldest institution of higher learning,[9] and the Harvard Corporation is its first chartered corporation.
      Although never formally affiliated with any denomination, the early College primarily trained Congregational and Unitarian clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th century, Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites.[10][11] Following the American Civil War, President Charles W. Eliot's long tenure (1869â€“1909) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900.[12] A. Lawrence Lowell, who followed Eliot, further reformed the undergraduate curriculum and undertook aggressive expansion of Harvard's land holdings and physical plant. James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II and began to reform the curriculum and liberalize admissions after the war. The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with Radcliffe College.
